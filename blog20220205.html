          <h2>Your Business Structure</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="row content">
          <div class="col-lg-12">
            At the start of each year, business owners typically review their affairs, including at times their trading
            structure. Others may be going into business and choosing their initial structure. There are four main
            business structures – sole trader, company, trust, and partnership (or a combination of these).
            <br><br>
            <h4>Sole trader</h4>
            This is how many businesses commence. Under this structure, an individual operates the business and is
            liable for all aspects of the business including income, debts and losses. These can’t be shared with any
            other individual. Advantages of this structure include simplicity, and minimal set up or ongoing costs.
            Disadvantages include personal liability, and also an inability to take on a business partner, noting
            however that as a sole trader you can still employ workers.
            <br><br>
            <h4>Company</h4>
            Here, the directors (and mainly in the case of small businesses, shareholders) run the business. The company
            itself pays tax on the income at a reasonably low company tax rate of 25%, though directors can be
            personally liable for tax if they are caught by the personal services income (PSI) rules. These rules can
            come in to play where the business income is a result of your personal effort, expertise or skills
            <br><br>
            Subject to any personal guarantees or any director penalty notices being issued, companies provide asset
            protection for the owners, potential legal tax minimisation, they easily allow the admission of new business
            partners, and they can trade anywhere in Australia. On the downside, companies are not eligible for the 50%
            CGT discount, are highly scrutinised and regulated, and are reasonably expensive to establish, maintain and
            wind up.
            <br><br>
            <h4>Trust</h4>
            This is quite a common business structure whereby the trustee holds your business on trust for the benefit
            of the beneficiaries (usually the business owners, but can include other parties such as family members,
            companies etc). The trustee can be a person or a company and is responsible for the operation of the trust
            including compliance with its deed. In practical terms, the beneficiaries pay tax on the trust income that
            they receive from the trust at their own tax rate. Note however that trust income may be caught by the PSI
            rules, see earlier.
            <br><br>
            The advantages of a trust include asset protection (even more so when there’s a corporate trustee),
            potential legal tax minimisation, and for family trusts compliance is relatively straightforward. On the
            downside, trusts can be complex, costly to establish, and on the tax front losses are trapped inside the
            structure and can only be used to offset future income. Trusts are also a strong focus of the ATO.
            <br><br>
            <h4>Partnership</h4>
            A partnership is a group or association of people who carry on a business and distribute income or losses
            between themselves (between two and up to 20 people). The partners themselves are liable for tax on the
            income from the partnership commensurate with their share of the partnership, however this is again subject
            to the PSI rules – see earlier. The losses and control of the business are also personally shared.
            Partnerships are governed by a partnership agreement which should be in writing and deal with all aspects of
            how the partnership operates.
            <br><br>
            Some of the advantages of operating a partnership is that they are easy to understand, reasonably
            inexpensive to set up and maintain, and other individuals can easily be admitted. On the other hand, there
            is no real asset protection, in that each partner is ‘jointly and severally’ liable for the partnership’s
            debts (that is, each partner is liable for their share of the partnership debts as well as being liable for
            all the debts). Each partner is also an agent of the partnership and is liable for actions by other
            partners.
            <br><br>
            <h4>Closing comment</h4>
            Aside from tax, there are many factors to consider when determining the best structure for your business,
            including ease of understanding, set up and compliance costs, the ability to admit new owners, asset
            protection etc.
            <br><br>
            You can change your business structure at any time, however there may be costs involved such as capital
            gains tax and stamp duty. Talk to your accountant if you are considering changing your structure or if you
            are going into business and choosing your initial structure.
