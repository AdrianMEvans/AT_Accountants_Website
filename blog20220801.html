            <span style="font-size:x-large;">The key purpose of superannuation is to provide individuals with benefits
              for their retirement, which is when most people will access their superannuation savings. But, in some
              cases, individuals may be able to access some of their superannuation early upon meeting certain
              eligibility rules.

            <h4>Common conditions of release</h4>
            A condition of release must be met before you can access your superannuation benefits. The most common
            conditions of release for paying benefits are when you:
            <br><br>
            <ul>
              <li> <i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>
                Have reached your preservation age and retire (see below for preservation age)
              </li>
              <li> <i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>
                Have reached your preservation age and begin a transition-to-retirement income stream
              </li>
              <li> <i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>
                Cease an employment arrangement on or after the age of 60
              </li>
              <li> <i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>
                Turn 65 years of age (even if you haven’t retired)
              </li>
              <li> <i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>
                Pass away.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Preservation age</h4>
            Access to superannuation benefits is generally restricted to individuals who have reached their preservation
            age. This is because the preservation rules aim to prevent early access to benefits.
            <br><br>
            The table below summarises when you may reach your preservation age and therefore potentially access your
            superannuation benefits:

            <h4>Other conditions of release</h4>
            Besides the common condition of release events that apply to most cases, there are other special
            circumstances where at least part of your superannuation benefits can be released before you have reached
            preservation age.
            <br><br>
            These less common condition of release events are summarised in the table below.
