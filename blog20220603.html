            <span style="font-size:x-large;">With the end of financial year (EOFY) fast approaching, now is a great time
              to boost your superannuation savings and potentially save on tax. Below are six superannuation strategies
              to consider before 30 June 2022.</span>
            <br><br>
            <h5>Tips to consider for your superannuation strategies:</h5>
            <br>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <span style="font-weight:bold">Use the carry forward concessional contribution rules</span>
                <br><br>
                If you want to make up for lost time and make extra contributions to top up your superannuation balance,
                you may be able to use the carry forward concessional contribution rules (otherwise known as “catch-up
                concessional” rules) to make large concessional contributions this year without exceeding your
                concessional contribution cap.
                <br><br>
                This strategy can allow you to carry forward any unused concessional contribution cap amounts that have
                accrued since 2018/19 for up to five financial years and use them to make concessional contributions in
                excess of the general annual concessional contribution cap (currently $27,500 in 2021/22).
                <br><br>
                You can then make a concessional contribution using the unused carry forward amounts this financial year
                provided your total superannuation balance (TSB) at 30 June 2021 was below $500,000
              </li>
              <br><br>
              <li>
                <span style="font-weight:bold">Make a personal deductible contribution</span>
                <br><br>
                Carry-forward contributions may also provide you with an opportunity to make higher amounts of personal
                deductible contributions in financial years where you may have a higher level of taxable income, for
                example, due to assessable capital gains.
                <br><br>
                But if you’re not eligible to use the carry forward rules to make a larger contribution, you can still
                boost your superannuation by making a personal deductible contribution up to the general concessional
                contribution cap.
                <br><br>
                It’s important to note that personal deductible contributions are only deductible if you meet all of the
                following conditions:
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                  <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>
                    You make the contribution to a complying superannuation fund
                  </li>
                  <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>
                    You are at least age 18 when the contribution is made (unless you derived income from carrying on a
                    business or from employment related activities)
                  </li>
                  <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>
                    You make the contribution within 28 days after the month in which you turn 75

                    ■ when you lodge your income tax return for the year the contributions were made, or

                The trustee of your superannuation fund must acknowledge receipt of the notice, and you cannot deduct

            <h4>What is Salary Sacrifice?</h4>
            An effective salary sacrifice agreement (SSA) involves you as an employee, agreeing in writing to forgo part
            of your future entitlement to salary or wages in return for your employer providing you with benefits of a
            similar value, such as increased employer superannuation contributions.
            <br><br>
            Contributions made through a SSA into superannuation are made with pre-tax dollars and do not form part of
            your assessable income.
            <br><br>
            This means salary sacrifice contributions are not taxed at your marginal tax rate (MTR) and will instead be
            subject to superannuation contributions tax of up to 15% when received by your superannuation fund and will
            count toward your concessional contributions (CC) cap.
            <br><br>
            The CC cap is a limit to how much you can contribute to superannuation. The combined total of your employer
            superannuation guarantee (SG) and salary sacrificed contributions must not be more than $27,500 per
            financial year. Note that there are other, very rare types of contributions that also contribute towards
            your CC cap.
            <br><br>
            For most people, the 15% contributions tax will be lower than their MTR. You benefit because you pay less
            tax while boosting your retirement savings.
            <br><br>
            Your employer also benefits because salary sacrifice contributions are tax deductible to them and there is
            no limit to the amount of their contribution/deduction.
            <br><br>
            However, this is not the case for employees. Salary sacrifice contributions in excess of your CC cap will be
            included in your assessable income and taxed at your MTR. You will however be entitled to a 15%
            non-refundable tax offset to compensate for the tax paid by the superannuation fund on the same excess
            contribution.

                    If you earn more than $250,000pa in income, you will pay an additional 15% tax on your CCs.
                    <br><br>
                    For many impacted people however, CCs are still worthwhile as even though they pay 30% tax on CCs,
                    this is still less than the top MTR of 47% (including Medicare levy) that applies to high income
                    earners who are liable for Division 293 tax.
                    <br><br>
                    The additional Division 293 tax is administered by the ATO who will work out if you need to pay the
                    tax based on information in your tax return and data the ATO receives from your superannuation
                    fund(s).

            <h4>The benefits of salary sacrifice</h4>
            <ul>
              <li> <i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>
                Disciplined approach to saving – individuals who struggle to save may benefit from salary sacrificing as
                contributions are deducted directly from pre-tax income. This automatic process can help you build your
                superannuation over the long-term and save for retirement.
              </li>
              <li> <i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>
                Tax saving is immediate – because contributions are made from pre-tax salary, the personal tax benefit
                is derived ‘up-front’. This means the saving goes straight to your superannuation fund and you can
                benefit from compounding returns on the tax saving amount (presuming the return is positive) throughout
                the year. </li>
              <li> <i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>
                Dollar cost averaging – salary sacrifice allows you to buy into the market at regular intervals and,
                therefore, reduce the risk of market timing.
              </li>
              <li> <i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>
                Easy to administer once established – you do not need to claim a deduction in your tax return or lodge a
                notice of intent form with your superannuation fund when salary sacrificing, unlike personal deductible
                contributions. </li>
              <li> <i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>
                Employer matching arrangements – salary sacrifice may also be attractive if your employer offers
                generous matching arrangements to their employees, for example, an additional 1% employer contribution
                for each 1% of salary sacrificed.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br><br>
            <h4>The key issues to consider</h4>
            <ul>
              <li> <i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>
                SSA may be ineffective – where your employer offers salary sacrifice, the arrangement must be in place
                before you have actually earned the entitlement. This means only income that relates to future
                employment and entitlements can be salary sacrificed into superannuation. This is known as an
                ‘effective’ SSA. With any bonus payments, the arrangement needs to be made before a decision to pay the
                bonus has been made. This applies even when the bonus won’t be paid until some time in the future.
              </li>
              <li> <i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>
                No control over when a salary sacrifice contribution will be made – all SSA should be documented and
                signed by you and your employer in writing. It should also include details outlining the amount to be
                salary sacrificed and frequency of contributions. This is because superannuation legislation does not
                specify the contribution frequency required for salary sacrifice contributions, unlike SG contributions.

                Employer may not offer salary sacrifice to employees – although most employers will offer SSA to their
                employees, it is not compulsory for an employer to offer salary sacrifice to their staff. Further, due
                to the paperwork involved and changes to the pay system, some employers may restrict their employees to
                one salary sacrifice negotiation per year, which can make it hard if the employee changes their mind if
                things change from month to month.

                Potential for excess CCs – once established, salary sacrifice should not be a ‘set and forget’ strategy.
                For example, your salary may increase/decrease, or the CC cap may change. Therefore, it is important to
                track the contributions regularly if aiming to maximise, and also stay within, the CC cap.

                    years (commencing from 1 July 2018).
