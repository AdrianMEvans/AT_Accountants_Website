            With Australia now opening back up after the COVID restrictions, unemployment is tipped to fall to the
            lowest rate in just over 50 years – down to under 4%. If over the coming period you hire new staff, there
            are certain steps you should follow to cover off on your tax, workplace, and superannuation obligations.
            <br><br>
            <h4>Confirm they are legally permitted to work in Australia</h4>
            Australian citizens, permanent residents and New Zealand citizens are legally permitted to work in
            Australia. If the worker does not fall into these categories, you must before employing them, confirm they
            have a visa granting them permission to work here. For more information, visit the Department of Home
            Affairs <a href="https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas" target="blank">website</a>
            <br><br>
            <h4>Employee or Contractor?</h4>
            Establish the nature of the engagement – is the worker an employee or contractor? This matters from a tax
            perspective because employers will have PAYG withholding obligations to employees. By contrast, no PAYG
            withholding obligations are owed to contractors unless there is a PAYG voluntary withholding agreement in
            place. You and a contract worker (payee) can enter into a voluntary agreement to withhold an amount of tax
            from each payment you make to them. This is a good way to help independent contractors meet their tax
            obligations. A voluntary agreement can cover a specific task or apply to successive arrangements between you
            and the worker. Either you or the contractor can end a voluntary agreement at any time by notifying the
            other in writing.
            <br><br>
            The employee/contractor distinction also matters for superannuation purposes. Employees are generally
            entitled to superannuation. From 1 July 2022, this also includes employees who earn less than $450 per
            month. On the other hand, contractors are not entitled to superannuation unless they work under a contract
            that is wholly or principally for their labour.
            <br><br>
            While in many cases, the status of a worker may be clear cut, if as an employer you are in any doubt about
            the character of the relationship, then you are encouraged by the ATO to use their Employee Contractor
            Decision Tool. The tool asks the user a series of questions, and then reaches as a result depending on the
            answers provided. Print out the result and keep it on file. If you need further guidance or disagree with
            the result, speak to your accountant.
            <br><br>
            <h4>Paperwork</h4>
            Before commencing employment, employees should complete the following forms:
            <br><br>
            <ul>
              <li> <i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>
                <span style="font-weight:bold">TFN declaration</span> – this is so employers can work out how much tax to
                withhold from employees.
              </li>
              <li> <i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>
                <span style="font-weight:bold">Standard super choice form</span> – to offer eligible employees their
                choice of superannuation fund. Employers must fill in the details of their nominated super fund, also
                known as a default fund, before providing the form to an employee.
              </li>
            </ul>
            Note that employees can now access and complete pre-filled commencement forms through ATO online services
            via myGov,
            <br><br>
            <h4>Request stapled super fund</h4>
            If you now take on a new employee and they don't choose a super fund, employers will have an extra step to
            take to comply with the choice of fund rules. That is, employers may need to request an employee’s ‘stapled
            super fund’ details from the ATO. A stapled super fund is an existing super account linked, or 'stapled', to
            an individual employee so it follows them as they change jobs. This aims to reduce account fees. Employers
            can request stapled super fund details from the ATO using ATO online services.
            <br><br>
            Some of the advantages of operating a partnership is that they are easy to understand, reasonably
            inexpensive to set up and maintain, and other individuals can easily be admitted. On the other hand, there
            is no real asset protection, in that each partner is ‘jointly and severally’ liable for the partnership’s
            debts (that is, each partner is liable for their share of the partnership debts as well as being liable for
            all the debts). Each partner is also an agent of the partnership and is liable for actions by other
            partners.
            <br><br>
            <h4>Confirm pay rates</h4>
            An employee’s minimum wages, including penalty rates, overtime rates, and allowances will in most cases be
            set out in the relevant workplace Award. Additionally, some employees have special minimum wages rates in
            their Award, for instance juniors, apprentices, and trainees. Contact Fair Work Australia on 13 13 94 if you
            are in any doubt about the applicable rates.
            <br><br>
            On the Fair Work front, employers are also generally required to provide new employees with a Fair Work
            Information Statement.
            <br><br>
            <h4>State and Territory Obligations</h4>
            Other issues may be in play when you take on a new employee, such a workers’ compensation coverage.
