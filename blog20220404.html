          <h2>Ridesharing</h2>
          Uber and other ride-sourcing facilitators have become increasingly popular over recent years.
          <br>
          From a Driver’s and a Rider's standpoint, there are a number of tax issues potentially in play.

              <h3>THE DRIVER</h3>
            </div>
            The below article explains the tax implications from a Driver’s perspective.
            <br><br>
            <h4>Income</h4>
            Income from a driver’s ride-sourcing activities must be declared in their tax return irrespective of the
            amount they earn, and irrespective of whether they have another job. The amount to be declared is the full
            fare (including or “grossed-up” by the facilitator’s fee, less GST). The full fare amount must be declared
            in a Driver’s personal tax return (or in an entity’s return if they are operating through a company, trust
            etc.).
            <br><br>
            <h4>Expenses</h4>
            Expenses (less GST) incurred by drivers in operating their ride-souring activities are deductible. However,
            not all expenses will be deductible and may need to be reduced/apportioned to take account of any private
            use of the vehicle. The following common expenses are not deductible – fines (e.g. speeding or parking),
            cost of own meals and drinks during shifts, and clothing except if either compulsory or noncompulsory
            clothing that is unique and distinctive to the Facilitator you drive for.
            <br><br>
            In instances where a vehicle is being claimed in the driver’s personal tax return, the costs will be claimed
            using either of the following methods:
            <br><br>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <span style="font-weight:bold">Cents per Kilometre</span>
                <br>
                Whereby you claim a set number of cents per kilometre travelled (currently 72 cents). The advantage of
                this method is very little record keeping is required. You only need to be able explain how you arrived
                at your calculation – you do not need any documentary evidence in the way of receipts or log books etc.
                Even where you travel more than 5,000 kilometres, you may still elect to use this method (and save the
                hassle on the record-keeping requirements that are required under the logbook method) by capping your
                claim at 5,000 kilometres. In summary, this method can be appealing to Drivers who:
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                  <li> <i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>
                    Have travelled less than 5,000 business kilometres o Have older vehicles (therefore depreciation and
                    interest costs are low)
                  </li>
                  <li> <i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>
                    Have not kept, or do not wish to keep, records of kilometres travelled. This method incorporates all
                    car expenses including petrol, servicing, depreciation, etc. You can make no further car expense
                    claim.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <br><br>
              <li>
                <span style="font-weight:bold">Logbook</span>
                <br>
                Under this method, your claim is based on the business use percentage of each car expense, which is
                determined by a logbook that must have been kept for a minimum 12-week period.
                <br><br>
                This logbook must be updated every five years or where there has been a change to the percentage of
                business use (by more than 10%). To ease the record-keeping burden, check out one of the innumerable
                logbook ‘apps’ on the market, either from the App Store or Google Play as the case may be.
                <br><br>
                In summary, under this method you can claim all expenses that relate to the operation of the car, at
                your percentage of business use, as established from your logbook. This method generally gives the best
                result where the vehicle has substantial business use. Drivers can calculate their claim and determine
                which method provides the largest deduction, by using the ATO’s Work-related car expenses calculator on
                its website.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <h4>ABN</h4>
            Uber drivers generally speaking will always be ‘carrying on an enterprise’, and therefore should register
            for an ABN. The only instance where it’s conceivable that a driver would not be carrying on an enterprise
            would be where they are an employee of the facilitator. This is rare, however.
            <br><br>
            <h4>GST</h4>
            Under general GST law, you are only required to register for where you are carrying on an enterprise and
            your annual turnover is $75,000 or more. However, where your enterprise involves providing ‘taxi travel’ you
            must register for GST irrespective of the level of turnover. The ATO adopts a broad interpretation of ‘taxi’
            to include cars made available for public hire to transport passengers in return for a fare (but not
            including trucks and bike courier services). The Federal Court has confirmed this interpretation. Drivers
            therefore generally must register for, and charge, GST as soon as they commence operating.

              <h3>THE RIDER</h3>
            </div>
            The below article examines the tax implications from a Rider’s perspective.
            <br><br>
            <h4>Deduction</h4>
            The same principles apply as per taxi fares. Where the fare is business-related, for example you are
            travelling from your office to a client’s premises, the fare will be deductible in full. However, where the
            travel is personal the fare is not deductible. This includes travel between home and work. That is, rips
            between your home and regular place of work can't be claimed even if you:
            <br><br>
            <ul>
              <li> <i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>
                live a long way from your regular place of work
              </li>
              <li> <i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>
                work outside normal business hours – for example, shift work or overtime
              </li>
              <li> <i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>
                do minor work-related tasks – for example, picking up the mail on the way to your regular place of work
                or home
              </li>
              <li> <i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>
                go between your home and your regular place of work more than once a day
              </li>
              <li> <i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>
                are on call – for example, you are on stand-by duty and your employer contacts you at home to come into
                work
              </li>
              <li> <i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>
                have no public transport near where you work
              </li>
              <li> <i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>
                do some work at home.
              </li>
            </ul>
            To evidence the deduction, the Rider will need documentation. The good news is that Uber, and we suspect
            other facilitators, will provide you with sufficient documentation to substantiate your deduction. You
            obtain this by logging back into their ‘app’ after the ride.
            <br><br>
            <h4>GST</h4>
            To claim GST on a fare, the trip must be business-related (see earlier), and the Rider must be in possession
            of a valid Tax Invoice. For quite a number of fares however, a Tax Invoice will not be required as the total
            fare may be less than $82.50 (including GST). Where this is the case, any of a Tax Invoice, a docket, an
            invoice, or a receipt will suffice and can form the basis for your GST claim.
            <br><br>
            The question then arises, what actual documentation does Uber or the Driver provide you with at the
            conclusion of the ride? In the vast majority of cases, the Driver will not provide you with any
            documentation (e.g. invoice etc.). Rather, after the ride, if you visit Uber’s ‘app’ they will on behalf of
            the Driver provide you with a tax invoice if the driver is registered for GST. Tax Invoices are provided by
            Uber even where the fare is below $82.50. We can confirm that the standard Uber-provided Tax Invoices are in
            full compliance with the ATO’s requirements. You will need to check the documentation of other facilitators
            for compliance.
            <br><br>
            <h4>ABN Withholding</h4>
            Another relevant tax issue for Riders is ABN Withholding. Under this regime, if a supplier of a good or
            service does not provide an ABN and the total payment for that good or service is more than $75 (excluding
            GST), the recipient generally has to withhold the top rate of tax (currently 45%) from the payment and pay
            it instead to the ATO. Having withheld from the payment, the recipient of the supply must then complete a
            PAYG payment summary - withholding where ABN not quoted and give it to the supplier at the same time the net
            amount is paid to them or as soon as possible after. However there are various exceptions that apply. In the
            absence of one of these exceptions applying, this then raises the question of whether the rider would be
            liable for penalties for failing to withhold.
            <br><br>
            The reality is that under a typical ride-sourcing model (and certainly with Uber), the Rider is not in a
            position to withhold the 45% penalty as the payment they make for the fare is in the form of a direct debit
            of the Rider’s credit card. Therefore, it would be very difficult to imagine the ATO penalising Riders for
            not withholding when, in a physical sense, they have no ability to do so.
