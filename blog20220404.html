              <h3>THE DRIVER</h3>
            </div>
            Uber and other ride-sourcing facilitators have become increasingly popular over recent years. From a
            driver’s standpoint, there are a number of tax issues potentially in play. See the following article for the
            tax implications from a rider’s perspective.
            <br><br>
            <h4>Income</h4>
            Income from a driver’s ride-sourcing activities must be declared in their tax return irrespective of the
            amount they earn, and irrespective of whether they have another job. The amount to be declared is the full
            fare (including or “grossed-up” by the facilitator’s fee, less GST). The full fare amount must be declared
            in a Driver’s personal tax return (or in an entity’s return if they are operating through a company, trust
            etc.).
            <br><br>
            <h4>Expenses</h4>
            Expenses (less GST) incurred by drivers in operating their ride-souring activities are deductible. However,
            not all expenses will be deductible and may need to be reduced/apportioned to take account of any private
            use of the vehicle. The following common expenses are not deductible – fines (e.g. speeding or parking),
            cost of own meals and drinks during shifts, and clothing except if either compulsory or noncompulsory
            clothing that is unique and distinctive to the Facilitator you drive for.
            <br><br>
            In instances where a vehicle is being claimed in the driver’s personal tax return, the costs will be claimed
            using either of the following methods:
            <br><br>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <span style="font-weight:bold">Cents per Kilometre</span>
                <br>
                Whereby you claim a set number of cents per kilometre travelled (currently 72 cents). The advantage of
                this method is very little record keeping is required. You only need to be able explain how you arrived
                at your calculation – you do not need any documentary evidence in the way of receipts or log books etc.
                Even where you travel more than 5,000 kilometres, you may still elect to use this method (and save the
                hassle on the record-keeping requirements that are required under the logbook method) by capping your
                claim at 5,000 kilometres. In summary, this method can be appealing to Drivers who:
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                  <li> <i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>
                    Have travelled less than 5,000 business kilometres o Have older vehicles (therefore depreciation and
                    interest costs are low)
                  </li>
                  <li> <i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>
                    Have not kept, or do not wish to keep, records of kilometres travelled. This method incorporates all
                    car expenses including petrol, servicing, depreciation, etc. You can make no further car expense
                    claim.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <br><br>
              <li>
                <span style="font-weight:bold">Logbook</span>
                <br>
                Under this method, your claim is based on the business use percentage of each car expense, which is
                determined by a logbook that must have been kept for a minimum 12-week period.
                <br><br>
                This logbook must be updated every five years or where there has been a change to the percentage of
                business use (by more than 10%). To ease the record-keeping burden, check out one of the innumerable
                logbook ‘apps’ on the market, either from the App Store or Google Play as the case may be.
                <br><br>
                In summary, under this method you can claim all expenses that relate to the operation of the car, at
                your percentage of business use, as established from your logbook. This method generally gives the best
                result where the vehicle has substantial business use. Drivers can calculate their claim and determine
                which method provides the largest deduction, by using the ATO’s Work-related car expenses calculator on
                its website.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <h4>ABN</h4>
            Uber drivers generally speaking will always be ‘carrying on an enterprise’, and therefore should register
            for an ABN. The only instance where it’s conceivable that a driver would not be carrying on an enterprise
            would be where they are an employee of the facilitator. This is rare, however.
            <br><br>
            <h4>GST</h4>
            Under general GST law, you are only required to register for where you are carrying on an enterprise and
            your annual turnover is $75,000 or more. However, where your enterprise involves providing ‘taxi travel’ you
            must register for GST irrespective of the level of turnover. The ATO adopts a broad interpretation of ‘taxi’
            to include cars made available for public hire to transport passengers in return for a fare (but not
            including trucks and bike courier services). The Federal Court has confirmed this interpretation. Drivers
            therefore generally must register for, and charge, GST as soon as they commence operating.
