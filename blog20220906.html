              Most people insure their personal assets, such as their house, contents and car, but when it comes to
              personal insurance, many overlook the importance of protecting their wealth because personal insurance is
              often seen as unnecessary, a luxury and an additional cost to pay for.
            </span>
            <br><br>
            <p>
              Unfortunately, we don’t know what’s around the corner but having the right level of protection in place
              will assist you and your family through sickness and injury and protect you and your family’s lifestyle
              when times get tough.
              <br><br>
              Depending on your needs, insurance can be structured either inside or outside superannuation, with most
              superannuation funds offering insurance for their members.
              <br><br>
              Superannuation funds generally offer three types of life insurance for their members, including life
              insurance, total and permanent disablement (TPD) insurance and income protection insurance. This article
              briefly summarises these insurances and covers some common benefits and considerations when owning
              insurance in superannuation.
            </p>
            <h4><span style="color:#fca311">Life insurance</span></h4>
            <p>
              Life insurance, also known as death cover, is a lump sum amount paid to your beneficiaries on top of the
              balance that’s already in your superannuation account if you pass away. It may also be paid if you have a
              terminal illness.
            </p>
            <h4><span style="color:#fca311">TPD insurance</span></h4>
            <p>
              Total and permanent disablement (or TPD) cover pays you a benefit if you become seriously disabled or are
              too sick to ever work again.
              <br><br>
              In addition to meeting the insurance policy definition of incapacity, you must also meet the permanent
              incapacity condition of release definition under superannuation law before the trustee can pay the TPD
              benefit to you.
              <br><br>
              Superannuation law defines permanent incapacity to mean:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span style="font-style: italic;">
                  "ill health (whether physical or mental), where the trustee is reasonably satisfied that the member is
                  unlikely, because of the ill heath, to engage in gainful employment for which the member is reasonably
                  qualified by education, training or experience".
                </span>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              To be ‘reasonably satisfied’, a superannuation fund trustee will usually request medical evidence in the
              form of two doctors’ certificates to that effect. This is to also satisfy the requirement for the payment
              of a disability superannuation benefit.
              <br><br>
              It is also worth noting that the superannuation law definition of permanent incapacity is generally
              referred to as an ‘any occupation’ definition of permanent incapacity because it relates to gainful
              employment ‘for
              which the member is reasonably qualified by education, training or experience’.
            </p>
            <h4><span style="color:#fca311">Income protection</span></h4>
            <p>
              Income protection (also called salary continuance insurance) helps replace your income if you can’t work
              due to a temporary disability or illness. If your claim is approved, your superannuation fund will pay you
              a regular income as a percentage of your salary for a specified period of time (ie, the benefit period
              could be for 2 years, 5 years or up to a certain age, such as age 65).
            </p>
            <h4><span style="color:#fca311">What about trauma cover?</span></h4>
            <p>
              Trauma cover (also known as critical illness cover) pays you a lump sum amount if you are diagnosed with a
              critical illness or injury as specified in the policy, such as cancer, stroke, coronary bypass or heart
              attack.
              <br><br>
              However due to changes in the law that came into effect on 1 July 2014, it is no longer possible to take
              out trauma insurance through your superannuation fund.
            </p>

            <h4><span style="color:#fca311">Factors to consider</span></h4>
            <p>
              The key benefits of insurance inside superannuation include:
            <ul>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>
                Premiums can be funded from your existing superannuation account balance, which can assist in managing
                your cashflow and affordability of premiums
              </li>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>
                You may benefit from income tax savings if you claim a tax deduction for personal contributions or if
                you contribute via a salary sacrifice arrangement using pre-tax salary which may provide cost savings on
                premiums
              </li>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>
                Insurance in employer superannuation plans may be cheaper than insurance outside superannuation as
                superannuation funds purchase insurance policies in bulk
              </li>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>
                After joining your employer’s default superannuation plan, you may be able to obtain automatic
                acceptance up to a set level of cover with no medicals required.
              </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              On the other hand, potential downsides of insurance inside superannuation include:
            <ul>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>
                The amount of cover you can get inside superannuation is often lower than the cover you can get outside
                superannuation. Further, default insurance through superannuation isn’t specific to your circumstances
                and some eligibility requirements may apply. To avoid this risk, you can purchase a retail insurance
                policy through superannuation (or personally outside of superannuation). While retail cover requires a
                more detailed application process, underwriting your personal history and generally higher premiums than
                default group cover, retail cover can provide you with better quality cover and greater confidence that
                a payment is likely to be made at claim time </li>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>
                Premiums can erode your retirement savings if you do not make extra contributions to negate the premium
                cost </li>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>
                Contributions made to fund premiums count towards the contribution caps </li>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>
                If you consolidate your superannuation accounts, you may lose any cover you have with the superannuation
                fund you close. Thus, you should always check that the new superannuation fund you’re choosing can cover
                you for equivalent (or more) insurance cover
              </li>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>
                Unless you actively opt-in to maintain your insurance, your cover may be cancelled if your
                superannuation fund becomes inactive for 16 months or more, the fund balance falls below $6,000 or you
                are under age 25. </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
